Genome-Scale Motif Searching in Python using motility and pygr
==============================================================

.. Contents::

Aug 3, 2008.

This tutorial is intended to give you a number of recipes for doing
basic kinds of genome-scale motif searching and feature correlation in
Python.

Let's start by importing a few Python modules.

   >>> import sys
   >>> sys.path.insert(0, 'code/')

First, motility:

   >>> import motility

and second, a few pygr modules:

   >>> from pygr import seqdb, cnestedlist

motility is a fast motif-searching toolkit that allows you to
search for consensus and matrix motifs in genomic sequence.  pygr is
a graph database package that can be used to load sequence and
sequence annotations into a format that's nice to query.

Loading genomic DNA
===================

Using pygr you can load and extract segments of genomes quite nicely.
Let's load in the Drosophila melanogaster genome:

  >>> d_mel = seqdb.BlastDB('/scratch2/titus/dros-ucsc/fa/dm3.fa')

Here, `dm3.fa` is just a FASTA file full of the chromosomal sequences
for Build 3 of the *Drosophila melanogaster* genome, and `BlastDB` gives
us a nice dictionary interface to it.  So, for example, we can iterate
through all of the chromosome names like so:

  >>> for k in d_mel:
  ...    print k
  chr2LHet
  chr2RHet
  chr3L
  chr3R
  chrM
  chrU
  chrUextra
  chrXHet
  chr2L
  chr2R
  chr3LHet
  chr3RHet
  chr4
  chrX
  chrYHet

If we want to extract DNA sequences, all we need to do is specify the
sequence name:

  >>> dna = d_mel['chr2L']
  >>> len(dna)
  23011544

To get (for example) the first 5 megabases of this sequence, just ask
for it as if 'dna' were a regular Python sequence:

  >>> dna[0:5000000]
  chr2L[0:5000000]

If you want the actual DNA sequence, just use 'str' to turn it into a string:

  >>> str(dna[0:50])
  'Cgacaatgcacgacagaggaagcagaacagatatttagattgcctctcat'

Searching DNA for consensus motifs
==================================

Suppose you want to search genomic DNA with a dorsal-like consensus
sequence, 'GGGWWWWCCC', where 'W' stands for 'A or T'.  (This is an
IUPAC symbol; see the bottom of the `motility intro
<http://cartwheel.caltech.edu/motility/intro.html>`__ for a short
guide.

First, extract the DNA you're interested in -- let's use the first megabase of
*D. mel.* chr2L for a starting point:

   >>> dna = str(dna[0:1000000])

Now search for matches using 'motility.find_iupac':

   >>> dorsal_matches = motility.find_iupac(dna, 'GGGWWWWCCC')

`dorsal_matches` now contains a list of tuples, with each tuple consisting of
four elements: the start and end of each match, the strand (+1 or -1),
and the actual motif matched.  For example,

   >>> print dorsal_matches[0]
   (180553, 180563, 1, 'GGGAAAACCC')

This tells you that there is a match to 'GGGWWWWCCC' from position 180553
to position 180563 on the top strand in chr2L, and that the match is
'GGGAAAACCC'.  Let's double-check -- is that what we get when we ask
the Drosophila genome for that sequence?

   >>> print d_mel['chr2L'][180553:180563]
   GGGAAAACCC

Note that it's also a reverse-complement match:

   >>> print -d_mel['chr2L'][180553:180563]
   GGGTTTTCCC

How many matches did we get, come to think of it?

   >>> len(dorsal_matches)
   14

Well, ok, that's not bad... but GGGWWWWCCC is not a perfect motif for
finding dorsal sites.  Many known dorsal sites don't match that exact
motif, so what we really want to do is do a weight-matrix search for
dorsal.  That should be more sensitive and specific.

(Digression: do you all know what a position-weight matrix is and
how it works?)

Searching DNA with a weight matrix
==================================

To build a weight matrix, you need a list of known binding sites.  In this
case, I've already downloaded and saved the Dorsal (Dl) binding sites
from Dr. Papatsenko's Web site in the file 'data/dorsal-site-list'.
This is just a straight text file full of binding sites, one to a line:

  >>> dorsal_sites = [ line.strip() for line in open('data/dorsal-site-list') ]
  >>> len(dorsal_sites)
  112
  >>> dorsal_sites[0]
  'GGGATTTCCC'

To make this into a PWM, you can use motility's 'make_pwm' function:

  >>> dorsal_pwm = motility.make_pwm(dorsal_sites)
  >>> print dorsal_pwm
  [[0.0, 2.3219280948873622, 4.5235619560570131, 3.2730184944064158],
   [0.0, 1.5849625007211561, 6.7279204545631988, 2.5849625007211561],
   [3.5235619560570131, 1.5849625007211561, 5.4093909361377017, 0.0],

   [4.0000000000000009, 0.0, 1.4150374992788444, 4.2479275134435861],
   [3.1699250014423122, 0.0, 0.0, 6.7142455176661224],
   [0.0, 2.8073549220576037, 2.5849625007211552, 6.6724253419714952],
   [0.0, 6.0443941193584534, 1.5849625007211561, 5.5235619560570131],
   [0.0, 6.8201789624151887, 0.0, 0.0],
   [0.0, 4.8579809951275728, 2.4150374992788444, 1.7369655941662066]]

There are a variety of ways to make a PWM, and you can read more about
`make_pwm` in the `motility tutorial
<http://cartwheel.caltech.edu/motility/python-tutorial.html>`__.  By
default, `make_pwm` calculates the log of the frequency of each
nucleotide's occurrence, which is why we have all the ugly numbers above.

Now, PWMs assign a score to any N-mer (in this case, 10-mer), if you
want to pick out specific sites, you need to choose a threshold below
which scores are too low to count.  There are a variety of ways of
doing this, and I'll leave you to figure out what makes sense to you.
I personally like to look at the scores of known sites; let's do that
by building a score for each of the input sites.

  >>> scores = [ dorsal_pwm.calc_score(site) for site in dorsal_sites ]
  >>> print 'min =', min(scores), '; max =', max(scores)
  min = 45.059492414 ; max = 55.2274791624

This tells us that using this PWM, built from the list of input sites,
the lowest score among those sites is 45.06, and the highest score is
55.23.  That low score is probably a good choice for a starting threshold;
let's see what happens when we search the first mb of chr2L in
*D. melanogaster.*

  >>> threshold = min(scores)
  >>> dorsal_matches = dorsal_pwm.find(dna, threshold)
  >>> len(dorsal_matches)
  5039

Whaah!  That's a lot of sites!  Why are there so many more PWM matches
in there than there are motif matches to 'GGGWWWWCCC'?!

Well, first, it turns out that the consensus for dorsal based on
those input sites is *much* looser than 'GGGWWWWCCC':

  >>> print motility.make_iupac_motif(dorsal_sites)
  NBNNNWBBCN

and if you search with *that* you find a lot more sites than with the PWM:

   >>> len(motility.find_iupac(dna, 'NBNNNWBBCN'))
   104611

Before we discuss these results more, let's look at what happens if we
choose a tighter threshold for the PWM; let's try taking the midpoint
between the high and the low scores from the input sites:

   >>> dorsal_matches = dorsal_pwm.find(dna, 50)
   >>> print len(dorsal_matches)
   388

Hmm, 10 times fewer than with a threshold of 45!

So what's going on here?

First, let's think about probabilities.  Assuming AT/GC content of
50/50, a 10 base matrix is going to match randomly at least once in a
megabase -- that's based on the calculating that a 10-base exact
sequences matches once in a million random sequences.  However, a PWM
is supposed to allow fuzzy matching, and for that you've got to drop
the threshold; since the number of random matches scales exponentially
up as the threshold stringency decreases, you actually get far more
matches than the strict case would predict.  That's why you get so many
more matches (5039) with a threshold of 45 than with a threshold of
50 (388).

Second, IUPAC consensus motifs are *guaranteed* to match at least
as many motifs as a PWM built from the same site list, if the PWM
score is chose as the lowest score among the input sites.  This is
because PWMs are more discriminating than IUPAC motifs, because
they assign weighted scores to each nucleotide in each position.  In turn,
this explains why you get many more matches (104611) with the IUPAC
consensus motif than with the PWM at a threshold of 45 (5039).

Third, thinking biologically, you should be extremely unhappy with
*all* of these results!  While there's only 388 matches in the first
megabase with a threshold of 50, the Drosophila genome is
approximately 180 mb in size. You would expect roughly 70,000 matches
in the entire genome, which seems biologically implausible -- and
that's if you choose a threshold that intentionally omits more than
half of the known Dorsal sites!

All in all, this is why motif searching is so frustrating.  PWMs have
a *very* high false positive rate, and you simply can't take a predicted
site at face value.  If someone hands you a bunch of 10 base sites and tells
you that you can use these sites to build a PWM and predict binding sites
on a genomic scale, *be skeptical* :).

Estimating false positives
==========================

Let's briefly digress and talk about the problem of false positives.
How can you estimate PWM false positive rates for a given threshold?

Well, motility has a very simple routine, 'weight_sites_over', that
can help you do this.  Let's try it out:

   >>> p1 = dorsal_pwm.weight_sites_over(45)
   >>> p2 = dorsal_pwm.weight_sites_over(50)
   >>> p3 = dorsal_pwm.weight_sites_over(55)
   >>> print '%g, %g, %g' % (p1, p2, p3)
   0.00210381, 0.000130653, 9.53674e-07

Basically what this function does is to calculate the number of
matches you'd expect at random with that threshold, in an infite-sized
genome with a 50/50 AT/GC content, represented as a probability per
base.  (You can modify the AT/GC content if you like; see the motility
docs.)

So, for example, in a mb of sequence, you'd expect the following
number of random matches with a threshold of 45, 50, and 55:

   >>> e1 = p1 * 1000000
   >>> e2 = p2 * 1000000
   >>> e3 = p3 * 1000000
   >>> print '%g, %g, %g' % (e1, e2, e3)
   2103.81, 130.653, 0.953674

Comparing that to the actual numbers for the thresholds of 45 and 50,
calculated above to be 5039 and 388 matches, that's pretty good -- it
implies that this PWM is picking up more sites than you would predict
you'd find at random.

Looking for homotypic clusters
==============================

Now, suppose you know that Dorsal multimerizes, so you'd expect to see
multiple binding sites close to each other (incidentally, it does :).
What is a good way to search for multiple sites in close proximity?

This is where we can start to leverage pygr a bit more.  Let's run through
an example first, and then I'll explain what's going on.

Start by running the search with the lowest threshold of 45, again:

  >>> threshold = min(scores)
  >>> dorsal_matches = dorsal_pwm.find(dna, threshold)
  >>> len(dorsal_matches)
  5039

Now, let's use a little routine I wrote to map these onto the Drosophila
melanogaster genome in a way that lets us retrieve them by proximity:

  >>> import pygr_motif
  >>> dorsal_map = pygr_motif.map_matches(d_mel, d_mel['chr2L'][:1000000], dorsal_matches)

(Note that we need to tell `pygr_motif` what sequences these came from --
in this case, 'chr2L', starting from position 0.  If these matches actually
came from another part of the genome, or start at a position other than 0,
we need to adjust the sequence slice we give to `map_matches` accordingly.)

Now, what 'dorsal_map' gives us is the ability to pull out motif
matches by sequence position.  Remember that section above where
d_mel['chr2L'][180553:180563] was a good match to a Dorsal consensus
site?  Let's see how many sites that region contains:

  >>> sites = dorsal_map[d_mel['chr2L'][180553:180563]].keys()
  >>> len(sites)
  2

Ah-hah!  That's right, there are two sites there!  What are they?

  >>> for site in sites:
  ...    print site.sequence
  GGGAAAACCC
  GGAAAACCC

OK, that's a bit strange -- why is one site only 9 bp?  It turns out
that pygr will return parts of any *overlapping* sites, too.  To change
this behavior you need to tell 'keys()', above, to return only full-length
matches, like so:

  >>> sites = dorsal_map[d_mel['chr2L'][180553:180563]].keys(minAlignSize=10)
  >>> len(sites)
  1

(You can see the other magic incantations that affect the behavior of
'keys' in the `pygr documentation
<http://bioinfo.mbi.ucla.edu/pygr_0_7_b3/sqlgraph-module.html#SECTION000237000000000000000>`__.)

OK, apart from that digression, at least we can get back what we put in.
How many sites are there in the 1 kb region centered on that site, though?

  >>> region = d_mel['chr2L'][180053:181063]
  >>> sites = dorsal_map[region].keys()
  >>> print len(sites)
  3

Three sites!  OK, where are they?

  >>> for k in sites:
  ...   print k.sequence.start, k.sequence.stop
  180257 180267
  180553 180563
  180554 180564

I will leave the significance calculation up to you (hint: not
very!). The point is that we can use this to build a general
cluster-finding algorithm, though.  How?  Well, since we can retrieve
sites by proximity, we could just iterate over the whole segment
looking for 1kb chunks of DNA that contain more than one site.  We could
also iterate over the *motifs*, and only start searching in a place
where there's already a motif.  To do that, we'll have to order the
motifs, though:

  >>> dorsal_matches = list(dorsal_matches)
  >>> dorsal_matches.sort()			# sort by start position

OK, now let's iterate over the matches, and save regions that have
two or more motifs in them:

  >>> CLUSTER_SIZE=300
  >>> save_regions = []

  >>> i = 0
  >>> while i < len(dorsal_matches):
  ...   start = dorsal_matches[i][0]	# start position of i'th motif
  ...
  ...   region = d_mel['chr2L'][start:start + CLUSTER_SIZE]
  ...   motifs = dorsal_map[region].keys()
  ...
  ...   if len(motifs) > 1:		# more than one motif? save.
  ...      save_regions.append(region)
  ...
  ...   i += len(motifs)		# skip forward 1 or more motifs.

  >>> print len(save_regions)
  1304

We can look at a few of these regions to see how many sites there are in each
region:

  >>> for region in save_regions[:5]:
  ...   print repr(region), len(dorsal_map[region].keys())
  chr2L[298:598] 2
  chr2L[756:1056] 2
  chr2L[1214:1514] 2
  chr2L[1672:1972] 2
  chr2L[2130:2430] 2

At this point we could do all sorts of fun things like calculate the
likelihood of seeing each cluster, or look at the distribution of
spacing between the sites, or look at their association with genes.
(We'll do this last one later on.)

Looking for heterotypic clusters
================================

Suppose we know that our transcription factor interacts with other
transcription factors, and we want to look for binding sites for
multiple transcription factors?

That's a pretty straightforward extension of everything that's gone above.
First, make the other PWMs (I'll use snail and twist here) and choose
thresholds:

  >>> snail_sites = [ site.strip() for site in open('data/snail-site-list') ]
  >>> snail_pwm = motility.make_pwm(snail_sites)
  >>> snail_threshold = min([ snail_pwm.calc_score(x) for x in snail_sites ])

  >>> twist_sites = [ site.strip() for site in open('data/twist-site-list') ]
  >>> twist_pwm = motility.make_pwm(twist_sites)
  >>> twist_threshold = min([ twist_pwm.calc_score(x) for x in twist_sites ])

Now, do your searches & convert into maps:

  >>> snail_matches = snail_pwm.find(dna, snail_threshold)
  >>> snail_map = pygr_motif.map_matches(d_mel, d_mel['chr2L'][:1000000], snail_matches)

  >>> twist_matches = twist_pwm.find(dna, twist_threshold)
  >>> twist_map = pygr_motif.map_matches(d_mel, d_mel['chr2L'][:1000000], twist_matches)

Now, do a search with a modified loop:

  >>> CLUSTER_SIZE=300
  >>> save_regions = []

  >>> i = 0
  >>> while i < len(dorsal_matches):
  ...   start = dorsal_matches[i][0]		# start position of i'th motif
  ...
  ...   # account for site within 300 bp of 0
  ...   cluster_start = max(0, start - CLUSTER_SIZE)	
  ...
  ...   region = d_mel['chr2L'][cluster_start:start + CLUSTER_SIZE]
  ...
  ...   snail_motifs = snail_map[region].keys()
  ...   twist_motifs = twist_map[region].keys()
  ...
  ...   # demand *both* snail and twist motifs, in addition to the dorsal site.
  ...   if len(snail_motifs) > 1 and len(twist_motifs) > 1:
  ...      save_regions.append(region)
  ...
  ...   i += 1

  >>> print len(save_regions)
  658

Note that with the above code, we could be double-counting some
regions in certain circumstances (two dorsal sites close by, for
example).  Putting the code to handle that in the loop is complicated,
but we can use sequence intersections and unions to join overlapping segments:

  >>> unique_regions = []
  >>> region = save_regions[0]
  >>> for i in range(1, len(save_regions)):
  ...    if region * save_regions[i]:		# intersect?
  ...       region += save_regions[i]		# join.
  ...    else:
  ...       unique_regions.append(region)
  ...       region = save_regions[i]
  >>> unique_regions.append(region)		# save last one, too.

How many are left?

  >>> print len(unique_regions)
  196

What do they contain, by way of dorsal, twist, and snail binding sites?

  >>> for region in unique_regions[:5]:
  ...   print repr(region), len(dorsal_map[region].keys()), \
  ...        len(twist_map[region].keys()), len(snail_map[region].keys())
  chr2L[9006:9606] 2 2 11
  chr2L[18500:19100] 1 3 5
  chr2L[21326:21926] 1 2 6
  chr2L[33699:34299] 1 3 8
  chr2L[51071:51671] 3 2 10

Hmm, that last one looks particularly interesting... I wonder what
gene it's near to?

Finding nearby genes
====================

Here we're going to skip over some complicated setup stuff that has
to do with installing various pygr data sources on your computer,
and we're just going to use pygr.Data to retrieve them.

First, import pygr.Data:

  >>> import pygr.Data

Now, retrieve the D. melanogaster genome,

  >>> dmel3 = pygr.Data.Bio.insects.dmel3()

and the map of all exons onto that sequence:

  >>> exon_map = pygr.Data.Bio.insects.dmel3_exon_map()

Extract chromosome 2L (what we've been using all along),

  >>> chr2L = dmel3['chr2L']

and now import a little utility I wrote called 'pygr_find' (in the
code/ subdirectory) that ...

  >>> import pygr_find
  >>> feature = pygr_find.find_nearest_feature(exon_map, chr2L, 51071)
  >>> print feature.name, feature.sequence.start, feature.sequence.stop
  AY089343.exon0 50222 52366

Well, that's interesting -- it's in an exon!  I wonder how many of the
clustered regions we found overlap with coding regions?

Coding overlap
==============

First, convert into "new" genome sequences...

  >>> unique_regions = [ chr2L[r.start:r.stop] for r in unique_regions ]

Now, assess coding overlap:

  >>> coding_overlap = 0
  >>> for region in unique_regions:
  ...    if exon_map[region].keys():
  ...       coding_overlap += 1

  >>> print len(unique_regions), coding_overlap
  196 76

Wow!  Over a third!

.. Correlating motifs with conservation
.. ====================================

.. #  >>> insect_conservation = pygr.Data.Bio.insects.multiz15way()
.. #  >>> for region in unique_regions:
.. #  ...
